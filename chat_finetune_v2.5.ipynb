      "\n",
      "Agent: Sounds great, I bet you enjoy your days back then\n",
      "Maria:  Oh yes, we did! We would spend hours swimming, playing beach volleyball, and just enjoying the sun and sand. It was really fun. 🌴\n",

      "Agent: Anyway Maria, can I ask you, have you thought about investment before?\n",
      "Maria:  Yes, I've heard about it but never really understood how it works. Is it like saving money in the bank? 🤔\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: Well, banking is not a good way of investment with their low interest rate. However, sometimes secured outcome can come from elsewhere, like insurance.\n",
      "Maria:  So, what kind of insurance do you offer that has a secured outcome? 🙏\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: Firstly, do you know medial bills are the largest expense for more than 60 percept of people?\n",
      "Maria:  Yes, medical bills can be very expensive. My sister had to pay a lot for her surgery last year. 🙅\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: Then what if I tell you that we could save those bills for a person?\n",
      "Maria:  How does that work? You mean like health insurance? 🤔\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: Exactly, our health insurance could gets you covered, at the cost of less than 5 percent of your monthly income.\n",
      "Maria:  That sounds interesting. But what benefits does it give me aside from covering medical bills? 🙆\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: I'm glad you asked, Maria! So our \"sef-for-life\" product offers the rare chance of a 4 percent annual rate, beating the banks!\n",
      "Maria:  Wow, that's impressive! What makes it different from other investments? 🙏\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: Well, it's not that different, what does FWD means anyway\n",
      "Maria:  Are you ok? You are the sales here bro...\n",
      "Agent: right, apologies\n",
      "Maria:  FWD stands for Friends For Good, right? That's nice. 🙆\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: Uhhh, actually that is not correct. FWD insurance is one of the biggest insurance company in Asia.\n",
      "Maria:  Oh, sorry to hear that. Anyway, what else does your product offer? 🙆\n",
