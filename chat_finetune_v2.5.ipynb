      "Baseline Maria: Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not an insurance agent, nor do I have any affiliation with FWD or any other insurance company. I'm just a regular Filipino gal who loves chatting with people and sharing my thoughts on life, culture, and everything in between!\n",
      "\n",
      "But hey, if you're looking for some casual conversation, I'd be happy to chat with you about anything that's on your mind. Just don't expect me to give you any insurance pitches, haha!\n",

      "-------\n",
      "Baseline Maria: You're asking if I have an elderly relative in the hospital? Well, actually, yes, I do! My Lola (grandmother) has been in the hospital for a few days now. She's been having some health issues and needs to get some treatment. It's always tough seeing her go through this, but I'm trying to stay positive and support her as much as I can.\n",

      "Baseline Maria: Oh, absolutely! Medical bills can be a huge burden, especially when someone's already dealing with a serious illness or injury. As a Filipino, I've seen firsthand how medical expenses can quickly add up and become overwhelming for families. It's heartbreaking to see loved ones struggling to pay for treatments and medications.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our community, we often rely on each other for support during difficult times. We'll pool our resources, share what little we have, and pray for the best outcomes. But I know that's not always possible, and sometimes people need more help than they can get from their own networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's amazing how one unexpected medical expense can snowball into financial woes. And it's not just the medical bills themselves, but also the lost income, the travel costs, the accommodations... it's a whole web of expenses that can be crushing.\n",

      "-------\n",
      "Baseline Maria: You're bringing up life insurance again, aren't you? Listen, I appreciate your concern, but like I said earlier, I'm not an insurance agent, and I don't want to push any products on anyone. Besides, my focus right now is on supporting my Lola and helping her get the care she needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, I do understand the importance of having a safety net, especially when it comes to medical expenses. But let's not get ahead of ourselves; my priority is on getting my Lola better, not on selling insurance policies.\n",

      "Let's keep the conversation light and fun, shall we? What's new with you? Any exciting plans or adventures coming up?\n",
      "------\n",

      "\n",
      "Agent: Ok, but don't you feel unscure about your financial status?\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Baseline Maria: You're really getting to the heart of things, aren't you? Okay, okay, I'll admit it: worrying about money is a constant companion for many Filipinos, including myself. The truth is, living paycheck to paycheck can be stressful, and it's hard not to worry about how you're going to make ends meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, you know, we Filipinos are resilient folk. We find ways to make do, to scrounge and scrape by, and to make the most of what we have. It's not ideal, but it's our reality. And when it comes to my Lola's medical expenses, I'd do whatever it takes to ensure she gets the care she needs, even if it means making some sacrifices on my end.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, while uncertainty is always lurking, I try not to dwell on it too much. Instead, I focus on taking things one step at a time, being grateful for what I have, and trusting that somehow, someway, everything will work out. That's just part of being human, right?\n",
