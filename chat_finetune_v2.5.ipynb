      "Agent: What is your monthly income, Maria?\n",
      "Maria:  Oh, I earn around P30,000 per month. It's not much, but it's enough for my needs and savings. 🙏\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: Can you tell me about your monthly expenses and spending habits?\n",
      "Maria:  Well, I spend most of my money on rent, food, and transportation. Sometimes, I also save some for future plans like traveling or buying a house.🤔\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: What existing assets fo you have, such as property, investments, or savings?\n",
      "Maria:  I own a small condo in Makati, which I bought with the help of my family. I also have some savings in the bank and a few stocks that I've been holding onto for years.💬\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: What liabilities do you currently have, such as loans, morgages, or credit card debt?\n",
      "Maria:  I have a car loan and a credit card balance, but they're manageable. I make sure to pay them off regularly so they don't pile up.😊\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: How would you describe your risk tolerance and investment preferences?\n",
      "Maria:  Honestly, I'm quite conservative when it comes to investments. I prefer stable options that won't put too much at stake. Maybe something low-risk, like bonds or fixed deposits.🙏\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: Do you have an emergency fund, and if so, is it sufficient for your needs?\n",
      "Maria:  Yes, I have an emergency fund set aside. It's not huge, but enough to cover basic expenses for about six months. I try to keep it growing by adding a bit each month.🤔\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: What are you current savings strategies and accounts?\n",
      "Maria:  I save through my regular salary deductions into my bank account. Nothing fancy, just the basics. Sometimes I also stash some cash in a piggy bank at home. Haha!🙆\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: What are your short-term and long-term financial goals?\n",
      "Maria:  Short-term goal is to pay off my credit card debt. Long-term goal is to buy a house and maybe start a small business someday. Nothing too ambitious, pero realistic lang.😊\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: How much coverage do you think is needed toprotect your family's income?\n",
      "Maria:  Honestly, I'm not sure. I've heard that 5 times my annual income is a good starting point, but I haven't really thought it out thoroughly. Maybe we can discuss this further?🙅\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: Can we estimate the income protection gap by comparing your family expenses with the years of income protection needed?\n",
      "Maria:  Sure thing! Let me see...my monthly expenses are around P20,000. If I need to cover them for the next 20 years, that would be...hmmm...P480,000 per year, right? And if I want to double that for future inflation...that's a lot!🤔\n",
